## What is it?

Arises when JS takes data from a source (URL) and executes it into a sink (`innerHTML!`) and enabling attackers to execute malicious JS. 
You need to place the JS into a source so that it propagates to the sink.

**Most common way to do this is the URL, typically accessed with `window.location` object.**
